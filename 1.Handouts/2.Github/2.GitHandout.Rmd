## OVERVIEW
During QB, you will have access to a dedicated Mac desktop computer located in Fine Arts 004. 
On this classroom computer, you will use the **cloud version** of RStudio (https://posit.cloud), which is accessible from anywhere and comes pre-installed with Git.
You will use Git and GitHub on the lab computer to manage QB **Worksheets**, which contain in-class **exercises** and **assignments** that will be submitted via GitHub. 
Today, you will learn how to **fork** and **clone** a GitHub repository. 
After modifying files in your workspace, you will learn how to **commit** and **push** those changes, enabling you to later retrieve your work using the **fetch** and **merge** commands.
In QB, assignments will be submitted to instructors for evaluation by making a **pull request** on GitHub.

***

## Using Git on Posit Cloud

## 1) Join the QB-2025 Workspace on Posit 

1. Sign in to your free Posit.cloud (https://posit.cloud/plans/free) account.
2. On Slack and Canvas, we will provide you with an invitation you to join the QB-2025 Workspace.
Click this link and accept the invitation.
3. After successfully joining, you will see in the left navigation bar, under **Spaces**, both *Your Workspace* and *QB-2025*.
Navigate to the *QB-2025* space by clicking it. 


The difference between *Your Workspace* and the *QB-2025 Workspace* lies in the available computational resources. 
When using a free Posit.cloud account (i.e., *Your Workspace*), memory is limited to 1 GB RAM. 
Some of the code we will execute in QB requires more. 
In the *QB-2025 Workspace*, you will be allocated additional RAM to support the completion of your assignments.

Please note that while files in *Your Workspace* are private and associated with your free account, instructors can view all projects created in the QB-2025 Workspace. 
This is because we serve as the administrators of "QB-2025," and privacy settings do not apply in this shared environment.
Last, the Posit Cloud subscription charge is proportional to usage. 
Therefore, we request that you only use the QB-2025 Workspace for class-related work. 

## 2) Create an empty R project & prepare Git

1. In the *QB-2025 Workspace*, click the upper right button that says New Project. Select "New RStudio Project", which will create an empty project.
Name this project "QB2025_Lastname" (e.g., QB2025_Smith).

2. By default, all new projects are set to "Private." Please ensure projects remain private so that **only you have editing access**.
Assignments will still be published publicly via Git, but keeping projects private helps prevent accidental edits to the wrong assignment, especially since Posit.Cloud automatically autosaves.

3. While Git comes pre-installed with Posit Cloud, we are going to make a few changes to the default settings of Git (configurations) so your Posit.Cloud workspace and Git interact with each other more smoothly. 

Inside your new R project (QB2025_LastName), you will see just below the file toolbar an area to type with three tabs: "Console", "Terminal", and "Background Jobs". 

4. Select "Terminal".  

The terminal, which is often called the "command line", allows a user to directly interact with the computing system through UNIX commands. 
This can be a useful way to change the default "under-the-hood" settings of a computer or to initiate code. 

5. Type the following lines into the terminal, line by line. 
Press enter at the end of each line to submit the line to the terminal. 
For variables like user.name and user.email, make sure to put in your own information!
(We advise using quotes as depicted in the configuration below.)

    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    git config --global push.default simple
    git config --global credential.helper store
    git config --global core.editor "nano"
    git config --global core.autocrlf input 
    ```
    
## 3) Open your Git Account (optional)
1. Navigate to https://github.com.
2. Sign in with your username and passphrase.
3. On the top right of your screen, click on your username.
4. Click on the Edit Profile Icon to edit your profile<br>.

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_edit_btn.png}

**You are now ready to** ***Git !!!***

## 4) Fork and Clone a Repo
1. Navigate to the QB student organization: https://github.com/QBstudents.
2. Click on the repository (repo) with your name.
This is going to be your **upstream** main branch for QB. 
It is where your instructors will put new files for week assignments. 
And when your assignments are complete, you will may a pull request to this location.
3. Fork your repo by clicking on the Fork icon in the top right of your screen<br>:

    \includegraphics[width=2cm]{images/github_fork_btn.png}

    You should now see the repo on your GitHub page.
  
4. Clone the repo into your empty RStudio project (named "QB2025_LastName") using the command line (Terminal).
Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repo" with the name of the repo in the QBstudent organization (e.g., "QB2025_LastName").

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo
    cd ./repo 
    git status
    ```
    The repo should have downloaded into your Posit cloud project. 
    The status should stay "all up to date". 
    
5. Check and update remote repo location.
The following commands will set the location of your **upstream remote repository** on the QB Course GitHub site. 
(In the example below, you will need to replace "repo" with the name of your QB Repository.)

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/QBstudents/repo
    git remote -v
    ```
    You can copy and paste the URL for your upstream repo from the GitHub website.
    Click the green "code" icon and select the SSH tab.
    To the right, you can click on the squares icon to copy the url to your clipboard. 
    Now, you can paste this into the Terminal to update the upstream remote. 

6. Inside the RStudio Project you currently have open, go to the top toolbar and select File -> Open.
Select the README.md file contained in your student repository.
Immediately following the text that already exists in this file, take a few minutes to do the following:
Enter your name and email address.
Write a short biography (~1 paragraph) and share something about yourself that we might not otherwise know. 
List three to five course expectations. 
You can learn more about Markdown formatting (e.g., making ordered lists) here: <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>.
When you are done, save the close the document.

## 5) GitHub Permissions
Before going any further, we need to set up our GitHub permissions.
GitHub no longer relies on passwords for security when performing functions. 
Instead, it uses a token authentication system.
Here are the instructions for setting this up. 

1. Go to your GitHub site (e.g., https://github.com/jaytlennon). 

2. Click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner.  

3. Click on "Settings".

4. Click on "Developer settings" on the left-hand side towards the bottom.  

5. Click on "Personal access tokens" on the left-hand side.

6. Choose the "Tokens (classic)" option.

7. Give your token an identifying name (e.g., "Posit Token") by filling in the Note textbox.

8. Select expiration date of 90 days.

9. Assign "read and write" permissions in the first section, called "repo". 
For this class, your token will not need permissions beyond this first section, but checking all permissions on the list will not hurt.

    \includegraphics{images/github_token_permissions.png}
    
10. After generating the token, make sure you copy and save; you will need this for next step. 

In the process above, token generation and verification is linked to Duo, which can be enabled in "Settings" under "Passwords and authentication". 
Most of you are already familiar with IU's use of Duo as a two-factor authentication system, but if needed, more information can be found [here](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0024565).
Duo will generate a GitHub associated six-digit code that you will be asked to supply to github.com       

## 6) Commit and Push
Now that your permissions are established, we can commit our changes and pushing them upstream to the remote repository with the following instructions:

1. You just changed the README.md file. 
To record this, we are going to create a **commit** or "revision" with the following code. 
The `status` function identifies changes you made, the `add` command adds a file to the "staging area", and the `commit` command sends the changes to your repository along with a message (-m).

    ```sh
    git status
    git add ./README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README.md with student information"
    ```

2. Now we will **push** the changes to GitHub.
But before we do this, we always want to check for any changes that others have made; otherwise we can create **conflicts** that need to be fixed. 
We check for these changes using the git commands **fetch** and **merge** as follows:

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

After "git fetch upstream", Terminal should prompt you for a username and password. 
Username is your github username (e.g.,: "jaytlennon"). 
The password is the **personal access token** you just generated, not the password you use to login to github. 
Note that when you paste your token into the password prompt in the Terminal, you will not be able to see the token characters. 

You should now see the repo, including your recent changes, on your GitHub webpage.

## 7) Pull Request
After pushing your commit, you need to follow up by making a **Pull Request**.

1. Navigate to your forked GitHub repo (github.com/username/QB2025_LastName) to make sure that the file (e.g., README.md) was uploaded correctly and has updated. 
If so, make a pull request to submit your file to the course instructors. <br>

2. To make a pull request, click the blue text (at the top of your repo) which indicates "this repo is x number of commits ahead" of the main (upstream) repo (github.com/QBStudents/QB2025_LastName).

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_commitahead.png}
  
3. Select the green "create pull request" button to start a pull request.

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_pr_btn_new.png}
    
4. For **future** homework assignments (worksheets), we will have you "assign" a pull request to the primary instructor of QB (Jay), so he knows when you have "turned" in your homework. 
To do that, click the settings symbol next "assignees" in the right hand column. 
Select jaytlennon. 
Then submit the pull request. The course instructors can now merge and see your changes.

     \includegraphics{images/github_assign_pull.png}

5. To update your README.md today, **do not assign** an instructor (jaytlennon) to the pull request, and inside submit and then accept the pull request yourself. Afterwards, you should see your QBStudents/QB2025_Lastname README.md has updated. 
    
## 8) Getting Up to Date   
2. To get new worksheets, you will *pull* your upstream repository to your local computer using the **fetch** and **merge**. 
This will allow any updates your instructors have made to be merged with your local documents.
In addition to pulling your upstream repo, you always want to push any updates to your origin.

    ```sh
    git status
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

During this course, you will receive **worksheets** and submit all **assignments** using these methods.
In addition, you will use Git and GitHub to contribute to assignments in class and on your personal computers.

## 9) Basic Git and GitHub glossary:
The terms below will be used throughout this class.
Some are commands that you will type into the terminal window. 
All are defined with respect to how we will be using Git and GitHub in this class.
