## OVERVIEW

During QB, you will have access to a dedicated Mac desktop computer that is physically located in Fine Arts 004. 
Installed on this lab computer is all the software required for the course.
In addition to using this during class period, you can access this lab computer using a Remote Desktop connection (see bullet 9 below)
You will use Git and GitHub on the lab computer to access and record changes to QB **worksheets** that contain in-class **exercises** and **assignments** that will eventually be submitted via Github.
The following instructions will show you how to configure github on a computer (lab or personal).
After that, you will learn how to **fork** and **clone** a GitHub repository. 
Finally, you will learn how to **commit** and **push** changes so that you can access them later on your personal computer using **fetch** and **merge** commands.  

***

## 1) Git Test
Before we get started with Git, we first need to test our current installation to make sure there are not any issues.
The easiest way to do this is to determine what Git version is currently installed.
We will use **Terminal** 

On the lab computers, you can find terminal in one of two ways. 
First, you can search for terminal with spotlight [Cmd+Space]. 
Second, you can navigate to **Utilities Folder** in Finder.
You may want to drag Terminal to the **Dock** at the bottom of your screen, as you will frequently be using this program.

1. Find Terminal and open a new window
2. After you have opened a new Terminal window (Shell > New Window), type the following commands, which will print your current working directory (pwd), list folders in your working directory (ls), and supply the version of installed git.

    ```sh
    pwd
    ls
    git --version
    ```

## 2) Git User Configuration
1. **Organization:** We recommend that you create a folder in your user directory called '*GitHub*' to make this and future assignments easier to manage. 
In the following code, you will move to your user directory using the `cd` (change directory) function.
The *slashdot* (./) specifies your current directory (../ would specify the directory above your current directory) and you will make a new directory with `mkdir` function. 

    ```sh
    cd ~
    mkdir ./GitHub
    cd ./GitHub
    pwd
    ```
    
2. **User Configuration:** You will need to configure your local Git installation.
You will do this by entering your name and email. 
You will also set two parameters: push.default and credential.helper

    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    git config --global push.default simple
    git config --global credential.helper store
    git config --global core.editor "nano"
    ```
    
3. The last thing you need to do is configure how Git handles line endings.
Line endings are invisible characters that your operating system places at the end of each line in a document.
On Unix machines (e.g., Mac), this is the linefeed character (LF).
On Windows machines, this is the carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) characters.
This difference in line endings between Mac and Windows causes incompatibilities between the two systems.
However, Git is equipped to handle the differences by silently converting line endings when repositories are pushed to remote servers.
We *strongly* urge that you configure this behavior in order to prevent any future issues (i.e., conflicts) when collaborating across computer platforms.

    **On Mac**

    ```sh
    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    ```

    **On Windows**

    ```sh
    git config --global core.autocrlf true
    ```    
    
**You are now ready to** ***Git !!!***

## 3) Create User
1. Navigate to https://github.com
2. Sign in with your Username and Passphrase
3. On the top right of your screen, click on your Username
4. Click on the Edit Profile Icon to edit your profile<br>

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_edit_btn.png}

## 4) Fork and Clone a Repo
1. Navigate to the QB student organization: https://github.com/QBstudents
2. Click on the repository (repo) with your name
3. Fork your repo by clicking on the Fork icon in the top right of your screen<br>

    \includegraphics[width=2cm]{images/github_fork_btn.png}

    You should now see the repo on your GitHub page.

4. Clone the repo onto your local machine using the command line (Terminal).
Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repo" with the name of the repo in the QBstudent organization (e.g., QB2023_Smith)

    ```sh
    cd ~/GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo
    cd ./repo
    git status
    ```

The repo should have downloaded onto your local computer and the status should stay "all up to date". 

5. Check and update remote repo location
The following commands will set the location of your **upstream remote repository** on the QB Course GitHub site. 
(In the example below, you will need to replace "repo" with the name of your QB Repository)

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/QBstudents/repo
    git remote -v
    ```
    You can copy and paste the URL for your upstream repo from the GitHub website.

6. Using RStudio, open and edit the README.md file contained in your student repository:

    This file is a Markdown file.
    Markdown is markup language for writing and editing text that can be easily converted to other formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, Word).
    During this semester, we will edit Markdown files using RStudio.
    On the lab computers, you can find RStudio in the **Analysis & Modeling Folder**.
    From RStudio, navigate to and open your README.md file in the root of your student repo.
    After the text "Quantitative Biodiveristy course, Spring 2023, Indiana University", enter your name and email address.
    Write a short biography (~1 paragraph) and share something about yourself that we might not otherwise know. 
    List three to five course expectations. 
    Hint: View the Markdown guide to learn about formatting and making ordered lists <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>. 
    When you are done, save the close the document.
    
## 5) GitHub Permissions
Before going any further, we need to set up our GitHub permissions. 
Recently, GitHub made the decision to move away from passwords.
Now, automatic token authentication is used. 
Here are the instructions for setting this up. 
1. Go to your GitHub site (e.g., https://github.com/jaytlennon)  

2. Click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner,  

3. Click on "Settings",  

4. Click on "Developer settings" on the left-hand side towards the bottom,  

5. Click on "Personal access tokens" on the left-hand side,  

6. Choose the "Fine-grained tokens" option,  

7. You want to assign "read and write" permissions for all repositories,  

8. Assign a token name and description for 90 days,  

9. After generating token, make sure you copy and save; you will need this for next step.  

In the process above, token generation and verification is linked to Duo, which can be enabled in "Settings" under "Passwords and authentication". 
Duo will generate a GitHub associated six-digit code that you will be asked to supply to github.com    

## 6) Commit and Push
Now that your permissions are established, we can commit our changes and pushing them upstream to the remote repository with the following instructions:

1. You just changed the README.md file. 
To record this, we are going to create a **commit** or "revision" with the following code. 
The `status` function identifies changes you made, the `add` command adds a file to the "staging area", and the `commit` command sends the changes to your repository along with a message (-m).

    ```sh
    git status
    git add ./README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README.md with student information"
    ```

2. Now we will **push** the changes to GitHub.
But before we do this, we always want to check for any changes that others have made; otherwise we can create **conflicts** that need to be fixed. 
We check for these changes using the git commands **fetch** and **merge** as follows:

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

You should now see the repo, including your recent changes, on your GitHub webpage.

## 7) Pull Request
After pushing your commit, you need to follow up by making a **Pull Request**.

1. Navigate to your GitHub webpage to make sure that the file (e.g., README.md) was uploaded correctly. 
If so, submit a pull request to submit your file to the course instructors. <br>

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_pr_btn.png}
  
    The course instructors can now merge and see your changes.
    
## 8) Getting Up to Date   
2. To get new worksheets, you will *pull* your upstream repository to your local computer using the **fetch** and **merge**. 
This will allow any updates your instructors have made to be merged with your local documents.
In addition to pulling your upstream repo, you always want to push any updates to your origin.

    ```sh
    git status
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

During this course, you will receive **worksheets** and submit all **assignments** using these methods.
In addition, you will use Git and GitHub to contribute to assignments in class and on your personal computers.

## 9) Basic Git and GitHub glossary:
The terms below will be used throughout this class.
Some are commands that you will type into the terminal window. 
All are defined with respect to how we will be using Git and GitHub in this class.

## 10) Remote Desktop

Ultimately, we hope that you will set up Git on your personal computer. 
But if you ever encounter any complications arising from software incompatibility, you have the ability to remotely log into one of the cloned Mac desktop computer in 004 Fine Arts that has all of the correct versions of software needed for QB.
Please follow these steps:

1. Visit https://storefront.iuanyware.iu.edu/Citrix/IUAnyWareCASWeb/ and click on "Apps" along the top banner
2. Select "Remote Desktop Connection" from the list of software
3. Enter the IP address that was assigned to you in the text box following "Computer" and hit "connect"
4. Supply your IU username and password
5. You should now see the desktop of the computer in 004 Fine Arts
